# Assembly Calculator Program

This is a simple calculator program written in Assembly language that supports basic arithmetic operations, factorials, and permutations. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator, and then performs the corresponding operation.

## Features
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Factorial (!)
- Permutation (p)

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the `main.asm` file.
2. Assemble and run the program using an assembler like [emu8086](http://www.emu8086.com/), or any other compatible assembler for the x86 architecture.
3. The program will prompt you to:
   - Enter the first number.
   - Choose an operator (e.g., +, -, *, /, !, p).
   - Enter the second number (if needed for the operator).
4. The result will be displayed on the screen.
5. If an invalid operator is entered, the program will notify you of the error.
6. If division by zero is attempted, the program will show an error message.
